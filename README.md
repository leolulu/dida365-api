# dida365-api

I use this project to auto schedule my task in Dida365.

Those who are intrested in dida365 api only could go directly to /api/dida365.py.


TODO:
* Use local config file to control parameters.
* Reschedule task from diffrent task group which built in same create date.
* Batch submit task.
* Build corresponding post payload simultaneously.
